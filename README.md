# Autonomous Raspberry-Bot with Vision-Based Detection
## Project Overview
This project presents an autonomous Raspberry Pi-based robot designed for surveillance
and target detection tasks. The robot follows a predefined line path and stops at specific
checkpoints to perform vision-based detection using a camera. Based on the detection result,
the system triggers physical responses such as motor control, camera movement, and sound output.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI inference can be integrated with real-world
robotic systems.

## Deployment Track
This project follows **Track B: Raspberry Pi Physical Computing**.
The system operates in a real-world environment by integrating camera-based vision detection,
sensor input, and physical robot actions such as movement, camera rotation, and audio output.
